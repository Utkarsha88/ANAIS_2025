Also, do spend some time and thinking on the definitions and readings, we will have an interactive discussion at the end. Teo and Alisia will demonstrate will demonstrate the solution to the exercise at the end of the turorial, don't hesitate to ask any questions!\n",

The element $(\\mathbb{u}, \\mathbb{v}) ∈ \\mathbb{E}$ is a directed from $\\mathbb{u}$ to $\\mathbb{v}$ and indicates a relationship between nodes $\\mathbb{u}$ and $\\mathbb{v}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most convenient way to represent a graph is by adjeciency matrix. Given a graph $\\mathbb{G}$ defined as above where $|\\mathbb{V}| = n$ nodes, $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a symmetric adjacency matrix where is $a_{i,j}$ is the weight of the edge between nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$. If $(v_i, v_j) \\notin E$ then $a_{i,j} = 0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graphs can store layers of information in the nodes and edges (features). For graphs with node features, each node $v_i \\in \\mathbb{V}$ has an associated $d$-dimensional feature vector $\\mathbf{x_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then the feature matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ can be used to represent the feature vectors for every node in the graph.\n"

GNNs update node representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes and edges (message passing). After several rounds of aggregation, each node’s representation encodes information about its local graph structure. This makes them powerful tools for tasks like node / edge / graph-level prediction or classification."

        "Today, we have learnt how to code a Message Passing GNN (GIN) and applied it to the task of link prediction (predicting whether two nodes are connected). Then, we dived into expressivity (a model's ability to learn and represent complex functions over graph-structured data) and tested it with WL-1. Finally, we explore robustness to input variations of GNNs (an important property, given that graphs are not-ordered) looking into both layer-equivariance (shuffled input at layer level reflect in the layer output accordingly) and model-invariance (shuffled input at model level should not impact predictions)."
