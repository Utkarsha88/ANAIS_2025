I will upload my daily pratice Notebook practiced during 11-Days program conducted by ANAIS_2025

### DAY_1
"We use a GIN-based message passing network to learn node embeddings. These embeddings are then combined in a decoder to predict whether an edge exists between two nodes. Negative sampling converts link prediction into a binary classification task. GIN is chosen because it matches the expressive power of the Weisfeiler–Lehman test."
